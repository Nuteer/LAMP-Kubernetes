Jenkinsfile
The Jenkinsfile in this repository uses the Jenkins Pipeline DSL to define a pipeline with three stages:

Build
In this stage, the pipeline runs the command mvn clean package, which builds the application.

Test
In this stage, the pipeline runs the command mvn test, which runs the tests for the application.

Deploy
In this stage, the pipeline runs the following commands:

aws cloudformation deploy --template-file infrastructure/cloudformation/stack.yml --stack-name my-stack
This command uses the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to deploy a CloudFormation stack. The aws cloudformation deploy command deploys a CloudFormation template, in this case the stack.yml file located in the infrastructure/cloudformation directory. The --template-file option specifies the path to the template file, and the --stack-name option specifies the name of the stack to create or update.

sh 'aws eks update-kubeconfig --name my-cluster'
This command uses the AWS CLI to update the kubeconfig file, which is used to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster. The aws eks update-kubeconfig command updates the kubeconfig file with the specified cluster name (in this case, my-cluster).

sh 'kubectl apply -f infrastructure/k8s/deployment.yml'
This command uses the kubectl command-line tool to apply a Kubernetes deployment. The kubectl apply command applies the configuration defined in the infrastructure/k8s/deployment.yml file to the cluster.

Configuring Laravel to log to CloudWatch
To configure Laravel to log to CloudWatch, you can use the CloudWatch Logs Agent to send the logs from the storage/logs/laravel.log file to CloudWatch. You can also set up a CloudWatch Alarm to notify you by email when there is a 500 error.

Managing environment variables with SSM
To manage environment variables with SSM, you can use the AWS CLI or SDKs to create and update the parameters in the SSM parameter store. You can also use the dotenv-editor package to automatically read and write the .env file from the SSM parameter store.

Conclusion
Once all the steps are done and the CI/CD pipeline is running correctly, you will have a public-facing Kubernetes cluster with a Laravel application that is automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the "production" branch, and logs are ingested into CloudWatch and notified by email when there is an error 500 error.
